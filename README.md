# The Moon 

Since ancient time’s humanity has used the moon to measure the passing of months due to its moving phases from full moon to new moon and back again. 

It is called the moon because it was used to measure the months. The word moon can be traced to the Old English word “mōna.” It shares its origin with the Latin words “metri”, which means to measure, and “mensis”, which means month.

Earth’s moon is the fifth largest of all the moons in the solar system.  The Moon is pretty big when comparing it to Earth, being a full quarter of the diameter of the planet. This is the biggest ratio, much bigger than for any other moon orbiting a planet.

The Moon has a diameter of about 3.470 km / 2. 156 mi, and on average it is about 380.000 km / 236.121 mi away from Earth. This means that 30 Earth’s could fit in between to cover the distance. The Moon has a radius of 1.079 mi / 1.737 km. It’s not even wider than the United States.

The Moon has a similar structure to that of the Earth: a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core, a thick mantle, and a crust of lighter materials on the top.

The core is believed to be around 350 km / 217 in radius with hot temperatures being present but not as high as in Earth’s core. The lower mantle may be a thick fluid, but unlike Earth’s mantle, the upper part is solid. 

The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning it always shows only one side of its surface to us. The side that we see called the near side is divided into two distinct types of regions:

– Highlands, which are heavily cratered

– Maria (Latin for seas), which are darker and smoother.

The Moon may as well act as a shield against space objects. The highlands were cratered by impacts over the eons from asteroid and comet collisions. Rocks from these regions have been dated to be about 4 billion years old, nearly as old as the Moon itself.

The maria region doesn’t have nearly as many craters. They are younger, appearing to be about 3.5 billion years old. The maria are made of darker, basaltic material, which means they probably formed from lava flooding older areas.

The dark side of the moon referred to as the “far side” remained a mystery for us for most of our existence. In 1959 the Soviet Union flew the Luna 3 space probe around the Moon, photographing the far side.

Expectations were that the far side would look like the near side. However, the far side was vastly different presenting almost no maria. The crust on the far side is thicker than on the near side. 

The only explanation for this has to do with how the moon was formed. The most well-known theory is the Giant Impact hypothesis. A Mars-sized planet slammed into the young Earth, not head-on impact but rather a grazing collision. 

The material from both planets was blasted into space and later formed the Moon. Though is it similar to Earth in composition, some rocks show a peculiar ratio of different kinds of oxygen atoms called isotopes, possibly being a piece of strong evidence for this theory. Further, the Moon was probably closer to Earth and suffered from Earth’s high temperatures at the time while the far side later suffered during the Late Heavy Bombardment.

There is a possibility that the Moon has water on it. Deep craters near the Moon’s poles have floors that never see sunlight. Comet impacts can distribute water all over the Moon, most of it being destroyed by the sunlight however, it can collect in these dark craters.

In fact, water was already discovered on the Moon but the water at the poles remains a bit hypothetical but very probable.

The Moon helps our planet be more livable by moderating Earth’s wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively steady climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humanity for thousands of years.

The Moon used to have active volcanoes but now they are dormant. It also has a thin and weak atmosphere, called an exosphere. 

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.

The Earth is constantly gaining and losing mass with the Moon distancing itself from us one inch every year. Humanity must continue to strive and colonize other planets for survival as nothing lasts forever, especially finite materials.

In one billion years the solar luminosity will increase by about 10% causing the atmosphere to become a “moist greenhouse”, resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans. In about 2-3 billion years Earth’s magnetic dynamo may cease. Future missions for the colonization of the Moon are being prepared by several nations as well as other important missions to other worlds.

This hopefully will finally put an end to the flat Earth conspiracy and to the Moon flight conspiracy, and maybe humanity will realize its true capability and raison d’etre, with the hopeful success of future space missions.
